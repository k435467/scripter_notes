# NoSQL

## Database Name Is Empty

`mongodb+srv://<cluster_name>.abcde.mongodb.net/<db_name>`

When working with Prisma we have to add a database name behind the URL.

## Client Side

Do not use mongodb in client side because it is nodejs only.

>./node_modules/.pnpm/mongodb@6.3.0/node_modules/mongodb/lib/client-side-encryption/state_machine.js Module not found: Can't resolve 'fs/promises'

## Rename Field

[Red](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75278317/mongodb-rename-fields-in-aggregation-pipeline). Rename a field that no need to specify all fields.

```jsx
{
  $set: {
    sale: '$sales'
    sales: '$$REMOVE'
  }
}
```
